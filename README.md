## About Me

I work in IT infrastructure and cloud operations. Most of my day-to-day involves Active Directory and Entra ID identity management, endpoint fleet management through Intune and NinjaOne RMM, Microsoft 365 administration, and writing automation that replaces repetitive manual processes.

Most of what's here came from real tickets and operational headaches. The write-ups cover what went wrong during development, not just the finished result.

**Technical areas:**
- Identity & Access Management (Active Directory, Microsoft Entra ID, Azure AD Connect, Hybrid Join)
- Endpoint Management (Microsoft Intune, BitLocker, CrowdStrike Falcon, Windows Defender for Endpoint)
- Scripting & Automation (PowerShell)
- Microsoft 365 Administration (Exchange Online, Teams, Microsoft Graph)
